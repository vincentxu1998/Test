Contents:

big: contains 11 directories that each contain an index. The files in these
	directories are books downloaded from the Gutenberg site 
	(http://www.gutenberg.org)

labs: contains 6 directories with the starter code and handouts for the labs
	from an old offering of 209. These indexes should be a bit smaller 
        and more useful for testing.

books: contains a single larger index for the book files in this directory.
